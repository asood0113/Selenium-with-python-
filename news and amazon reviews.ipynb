      "Decent earphones for the price\n",
      "Reviewed in India on 12 January 2020\n",
      "Colour: Black & YellowVerified Purchase\n",
      "This is my third Bluetooth neckband, I own a House of Marley, a Realme Bud and this one. A brief comparison on some key parameters and a short review of this one.\n",
      "Battery: The Realme does standout, lasts much longer than the other two, charging too is quite fast, the Infinity Glide came fully charged and dropped to 80% with about 60 minutes of usage, at this rate I guess it may last for just about 5-6 hours at the most. Charging is reasonably fast.\n",
      "Comfort: This is pretty light and comfortable, the wires connecting the buds are not as stiff as the realme ones, the original earbuds fit perfectly and caused no pain or discomfort, the band round the neck too is comfortable, better than the Realme and the House of Marley. All three come with extra pairs of buds. Fits well and does not pop out while jogging or walking, the same holds for the other two devices compared as well.\n",
      "Sound quality: The house of Marley was good while it lasted, alas, the Right bud stopped working after two years. The Realme too is good, though I found the highs missing in a few popular songs. The Infinity Glide is just about ok, the bass is present, but I found the highs missing, and some songs, thought the vocals sounded a bit dull (sort of muffled), but tastes differ. House of Marley was the best followed by the Realme, this one would just be ok for me. Both the Realme and the Glide had no noticeable lag when playing videos.\n",
      "Features: The Realme feature of connecting and disconnecting using the magnetic buds was awesome, no such feature exists in Glide. The Glide though has a small cover to close the USB charging slot, the Realme has no such cover. The Glide has a BT 5.0, while the others don't, I found the connection strong even with a wall in between. The Dual EQ usage was a bit difficult, simultaneous pressing of the two-volume buttons cumbersome and the Bluetooth kept getting disconnected, also the phone had to be reconnected to the earphone each time the earphone was powered on, this I found to be seamless in Realme. The track change is a long press in the Glide, needs time to get used to this as I ended up increasing the volume several times while changing the track. The Glide is supposed to be splash-proof, though I have not tried this.\n",
      "Call quality: Realme beats the other two hands down on this. House of Marley was the worst. If one uses the earphone for calling as a primary purpose, the Realme should be a better option.\n",
      "Looks and Feel: Realme looks premium, followed by the Marley earphone. The Glide has the infinity symbol on the buds flat outer surface, while the Realme does not even sport a logo. I would put Realme on top of the list.\n",
      "Durability: The House of Marley earphones lasted just about two years, the Realme is about three months old, and going strong, need to see how long the Infinity Glide lasts.\n",
      "Verdict: If the difference of 500Rs between the Realme and the Glide is not very significant, I would recommend the Realme. But if 500Rs is a big difference, then the Glide is pretty functional, decent sound and comfort, my only concern would be the battery, 5-6 hours is all that I think it could give on first use, while the Realme gave me 8 hours easily on one charge. I guess the disconnect feature while not in use comes in handy for the Realme.\n",

      "Reviewed in India on 11 January 2020\n",
      "Colour: Black & YellowVerified Purchase\n",
      "Was a bit skeptical while thinking of buying this since there were not much review online and purchased by seeing just 2 reviews one on amazon and one on youtube and rest by seeing the specs of 12mm driver and EQ mode ,\n",
      "Also this is my first bluetooth earphones purchased and have used sennheiser wired one before\n",
      "Now about the earphones\n",
      "1- The plastic quality is good,\n",
      "2- Sound Quality which is the main highlight is much better in my opinion then my friends boat wireless and I am highly satisfied to use it switching from my wired sennheiser because the sound quality for me is not much different and if its about base then this device is much stronger in deep base mode.\n",
      "3- for new users you might feel the volume - button to not feel tacktile compared to Volume+, its because of lower surface area for the Vol- button which is not a problem.\n",
      "4 - comes with 1 year warranty and would like to see how long lasting this device would be for me ..\n",

      "Colour: Black & YellowVerified Purchase\n",
      "This is my third Bluetooth neckband, I own a House of Marley, a Realme Bud and this one. A brief comparison on some key parameters and a short review of this one.\n",
      "Battery: The Realme does standout, lasts much longer than the other two, charging too is quite fast, the Infinity Glide came fully charged and dropped to 80% with about 60 minutes of usage, at this rate I guess it may last for just about 5-6 hours at the most. Charging is reasonably fast.\n",
      "Comfort: This is pretty light and comfortable, the wires connecting the buds are not as stiff as the realme ones, the original earbuds fit perfectly and caused no pain or discomfort, the band round the neck too is comfortable, better than the Realme and the House of Marley. All three come with extra pairs of buds. Fits well and does not pop out while jogging or walking, the same holds for the other two devices compared as well.\n",
      "Sound quality: The house of Marley was good while it lasted, alas, the Right bud stopped working after two years. The Realme too is good, though I found the highs missing in a few popular songs. The Infinity Glide is just about ok, the bass is present, but I found the highs missing, and some songs, thought the vocals sounded a bit dull (sort of muffled), but tastes differ. House of Marley was the best followed by the Realme, this one would just be ok for me. Both the Realme and the Glide had no noticeable lag when playing videos.\n",
      "Features: The Realme feature of connecting and disconnecting using the magnetic buds was awesome, no such feature exists in Glide. The Glide though has a small cover to close the USB charging slot, the Realme has no such cover. The Glide has a BT 5.0, while the others don't, I found the connection strong even with a wall in between. The Dual EQ usage was a bit difficult, simultaneous pressing of the two-volume buttons cumbersome and the Bluetooth kept getting disconnected, also the phone had to be reconnected to the earphone each time the earphone was powered on, this I found to be seamless in Realme. The track change is a long press in the Glide, needs time to get used to this as I ended up increasing the volume several times while changing the track. The Glide is supposed to be splash-proof, though I have not tried this.\n",
      "Call quality: Realme beats the other two hands down on this. House of Marley was the worst. If one uses the earphone for calling as a primary purpose, the Realme should be a better option.\n",
      "Looks and Feel: Realme looks premium, followed by the Marley earphone. The Glide has the infinity symbol on the buds flat outer surface, while the Realme does not even sport a logo. I would put Realme on top of the list.\n",
      "Durability: The House of Marley earphones lasted just about two years, the Realme is about three months old, and going strong, need to see how long the Infinity Glide lasts.\n",
      "Verdict: If the difference of 500Rs between the Realme and the Glide is not very significant, I would recommend the Realme. But if 500Rs is a big difference, then the Glide is pretty functional, decent sound and comfort, my only concern would be the battery, 5-6 hours is all that I think it could give on first use, while the Realme gave me 8 hours easily on one charge. I guess the disconnect feature while not in use comes in handy for the Realme.\n",
